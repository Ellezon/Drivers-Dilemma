# Drivers-Dilemma
The aim of this study is to determine how autonomous vehicles should be programmed to react in the event of a car accident where harm to another life is unavoidable. With the use of a web-based simulation, participants were placed in the driver’s seat of a car and shown variations of the trolley problem. They were allowed to choose the accident’s outcome in a short amount of time. The results concluded that there were a good number of people who would choose to sacrifice themselves over the lives of others. When it comes to decisions between lives of pedestrians, animals and old people were least likely to be saved, while children and pregnant women were most likely to be saved. It was also concluded that the utilitarian approach is very prevalent in this type of scenario, with the vast majority of participants choosing to save the highest number of lives.
